            My favourite vacation spot is Banglore.
        </h4>
        <p>
            I like banglore due to several reasons. Bangalore is known for its <b>pleasant climate</b> 
            throughout the year. The city's elevation gives it a milder climate compared to many other 
            Indian cities, with relatively cooler temperatures. Bangalore is often referred to as the 
            <b>Silicon Valley of India</b> due to its thriving IT industry. Many tech companies and 
            startups have established their presence here, attracting a skilled workforce from all over 
            the country.
